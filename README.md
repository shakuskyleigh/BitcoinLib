Instructions for Bitcoin
------------------------

- Locate your `bitcoin.conf` file (in Windows it's under: `%AppData%\Roaming\Bitcoin`, if it's not there just go ahead and create it) and add these lines:
	- rpcuser = MyRpcUsername
	- rpcpassword = MyRpcPassword
	- server=1
	- txindex=1

- Edit the `app.config` file in the Console test client to best fit your needs. Make sure you also update the `bitcoin.conf` file when you alter the `Bitcoin_RpcUsername` and `Bitcoin_RpcPassword` parameters.


Instructions for Litecoin and other Bitcoin clones
--------------------------------------------------

- Perform the same steps as those mentioned above for Bitcoin.

- Litecoin configuration file is: `litecoin.conf` under: `%AppData%\Roaming\Litecoin` and its daemon is: `litecoind`.

- Each coin can be initialized by its own interface specification:
	- `IBitcoinService BitcoinService = new BitcoinService();` 
	- `ILitecoinService LitecoinService = new LitecoinService();` 

- Any bitcoin clone can be adopted without any further installation steps with the use of the generic `ICryptocoinService`:
	- `ICryptocoinService cryptocoinService = new CryptocoinService("daemonUrl", "rpcUsername", "rpcPassword", "walletPassword");`

- Use `(ICryptocoinService).Parameters` to fully configure each coin pointer at run-time.
